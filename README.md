# Porfolio Website

This is [my portfolio website](https://www.richardogujawa.com) made using NextJS, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. 

This was my first real build using NextJS, and I learned a lot from it: 
- How to use TypeScript as opposed to JavaScript because it can help you identify bugs early and easily.
- How to perform CRUD operations on a database
- How to use Tailwind CSS in conjunction with normal CSS to rapidly style your page.

This was a big step up for me, given that up until this point I was pretty much stuck on building things from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and procrastinated going into React for a looooong time. However, learning NextJS opened my eyes up to the limitations of those intial three languages and how much fun learning new ones can be. 

I'm a lot more curious about what else is out there, and am now looking into ReactJS, and down the line hope to venture into languages like Java, Flutter, C# and Python.

The original design of the website was done in Adobe XD, and the logos and icons were tweaked and manipulatd using Photoshop and Illustrator.
